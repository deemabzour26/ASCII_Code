                  (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) is a system that assigns a unique number to eachcharacter  
               

                                                                                    
                                  letters, numbers, and symbols, so computers can store and communicate text  .
                                                                                            
                                   For example, the letter A is represented by the number 65 in ASCII                         .




ASCII code (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) is a standard system used in computers and electronic devices to represent text and symbols.
                        
    It assigns a unique number (from 0 to 127) to each character, such as letters, digits, punctuation marks, and control signals.
                                                                    
                                                                       These numbers are used by computers to process and store text as numerical data                     .



For example:
•	A → 65
•	a → 97
•	0 → 48
ASCII forms the basis of modern text encoding and is widely used in programming, data formats, and communication protocols
